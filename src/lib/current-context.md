# OpenSCAD Tree-sitter Parser - Current Context

## Project Overview

The OpenSCAD Tree-sitter Parser project aims to create a parser for OpenSCAD code using tree-sitter to generate a Concrete Syntax Tree (CST), and then convert that CST to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with structured types. The parser leverages tree-sitter's capabilities, including treeCursor, queries, and other features to facilitate this transformation.

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented the visitor pattern for CST traversal and AST generation:

1. Fixed ControlStructureVisitor class implementation:
   - Added createASTNodeForFunction method to handle control structure functions
   - Implemented createIfNode, createForNode, createLetNode, and createEachNode methods
   - Added tests for the ControlStructureVisitor class
   - Fixed issues with parameter extraction and node traversal

2. Fixed PrimitiveVisitor tests to use mocks instead of real parser:
   - Updated tests to mock the necessary node structure
   - Added namedChildren property to mock nodes
   - Fixed parameter extraction in tests

3. Fixed BaseASTVisitor to handle expression nodes correctly:
   - Updated visitNode method to handle different node types
   - Fixed visitStatement method to handle expression statements
   - Added visitExpression method to handle expression nodes

## Next Steps

1. Add support for expression visitors to handle complex expressions:
   - Create an ExpressionVisitor class to handle different types of expressions
   - Implement methods for binary expressions, unary expressions, conditional expressions, etc.
   - Add tests for all expression types
   - Update visitor-ast-generator.ts to include the new visitor

2. Fix remaining failing tests in the openscad-parser directory:
   - Update openscad-parser-visitor.test.ts to match the actual behavior
   - Fix ast-generator.integration.test.ts to use correct expected values
   - Update visitor-ast-generator.test.ts to handle the actual tree-sitter CST structure

3. Improve error handling and recovery strategies:
   - Enhance error reporting with more detailed messages
   - Implement recovery strategies for common syntax errors

4. Add support for more OpenSCAD features:
   - Implement visitors for more advanced features like modules and functions
   - Add tests for these features
