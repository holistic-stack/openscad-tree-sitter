# OpenSCAD Tree-sitter Parser - Current Context

## Project Overview

The OpenSCAD Tree-sitter Parser project aims to create a parser for OpenSCAD code using tree-sitter to generate a Concrete Syntax Tree (CST), and then convert that CST to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with structured types. The parser leverages tree-sitter's capabilities, including treeCursor, queries, and other features to facilitate this transformation.

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented control structure visitors for if, for, let, and each statements:

1. Created ControlStructureVisitor class to handle control structures:
   - Implemented visitIfStatement method to handle if-else and if-else-if-else statements
   - Implemented visitForStatement method to handle for loops with different variable formats
   - Implemented visitLetExpression method to handle let expressions with assignments
   - Implemented visitEachStatement method to handle each statements
   - Added tests for all control structure types
   - Updated visitor-ast-generator.ts to include the new visitor

2. Fixed CSGVisitor to handle difference and intersection operations correctly
3. Refactored TransformVisitor to use a more general approach for handling accessor expressions
4. Fixed cursor-utils.test.ts to use the correct tree-sitter API

## Next Steps

1. Add support for expression visitors to handle complex expressions:
   - Create an ExpressionVisitor class to handle different types of expressions
   - Implement methods for binary expressions, unary expressions, conditional expressions, etc.
   - Add tests for all expression types
   - Update visitor-ast-generator.ts to include the new visitor

2. Add more comprehensive tests for all OpenSCAD constructs:
   - Add tests for complex combinations of control structures and expressions
   - Add tests for edge cases and error handling

3. Improve error handling and recovery strategies:
   - Enhance error reporting with more detailed messages
   - Implement recovery strategies for common syntax errors

4. Add support for more OpenSCAD features:
   - Implement visitors for more advanced features
   - Add tests for these features
