- [x] Implemented hull and minkowski CSG operations

#### Testing
- [x] Unit tests for core components
- [x] Integration tests for parser
- [x] Test coverage for node adapters
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Query Files
- [x] `highlights.scm` - Syntax highlighting queries
- [x] `dependencies.scm` - Dependency analysis queries
- [x] `folds.scm` - Code folding regions

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Parser Layer**: Handles raw text parsing into CST
2. **Query Layer**: Provides utilities for querying the CST
3. **AST Layer**: Transforms CST into a more usable AST
4. **Adapters**: Convert between tree-sitter nodes and domain-specific AST nodes

## Recent Achievements

- Implemented initial AST generator for OpenSCAD code
- Added support for cube primitives and translate transformations
- Created integration tests for AST generation
- Refactored code to follow DRY and SRP principles
- Set up modular architecture for AST generation
- Implemented sphere and cylinder primitives
- Implemented rotate and scale transformations
- Implemented union, difference, and intersection CSG operations
- Created a direct AST generator for testing purposes
- Implemented control structures (if statements, for loops, let expressions)
- Added tests for control structures
- Implemented module and function system (definitions and instantiations)
- Added support for module parameters and children
- Added tests for modules and functions
- Implemented polyhedron primitive
- Implemented 2D primitives (circle, square, polygon, text)
- Implemented extrusion operations (linear_extrude, rotate_extrude)
- Added tests for new primitives and extrusion operations
- Implemented remaining transformations (mirror, multmatrix, color, offset)
- Added tests for transformations

## Next Steps

See [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for detailed next steps and implementation tasks.

## Known Issues

- Some edge cases in complex expressions need additional testing
- Performance optimizations may be needed for large files
- Some AST node types may need refinement based on real-world usage
- The CSG Generator currently doesn't handle all types of child nodes correctly
- Some tests for transformations (scale, mirror, multmatrix, color, offset) are failing
- Some tests for union operations are failing
