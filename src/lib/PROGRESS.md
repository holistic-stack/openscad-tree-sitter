## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Parser Layer**: Handles raw text parsing into CST
2. **Query Layer**: Provides utilities for querying the CST
3. **AST Layer**: Transforms CST into a more usable AST
4. **Adapters**: Convert between tree-sitter nodes and domain-specific AST nodes
5. **Visitors**: Traverse the CST and generate AST nodes
   - **Base Visitor**: Provides common traversal functionality
   - **Specialized Visitors**: Handle specific node types (primitives, transformations, CSG operations)
   - **Composite Visitor**: Delegates to specialized visitors based on node type

### Current Issues
- Union tests are failing due to an unterminated string literal in the DirectASTGenerator.ts file
- There are still failing tests in other modules (difference, intersection, primitives, module-function)
- The ModularASTGenerator needs to be updated to handle these other modules
- Some tests are using parseToAST instead of parseAST, which is causing errors
- The primitive-visitor.test.ts tests are failing because they're looking for module_instantiation nodes, but the tree-sitter CST structure uses call_expression nodes instead
- The composite-visitor.test.ts tests are failing for similar reasons

### Next Steps
- Fix the primitive-visitor.test.ts tests to use the correct node types
- Fix the composite-visitor.test.ts tests to use the correct node types
- Fix the string literal issue in the union operations implementation
- Implement support for difference and intersection operations
- Fix the module and function tests
- Update the ModularASTGenerator to handle all types of operations
- Implement module and function visitors
- Implement control structure visitors
- Add support for expression visitors
- Implement query caching and optimization
- Implement registry system for node handlers

## Known Issues

- Some edge cases in complex expressions need additional testing
- Performance optimizations may be needed for large files
- Some AST node types may need refinement based on real-world usage
- The CSG Generator currently doesn't handle all types of child nodes correctly
- Union operations have an issue with unterminated string literals
- Difference and intersection operations are not fully implemented
- Module and function definitions and calls need more work
- Some tests are using parseToAST instead of parseAST, which is causing errors
- The tree-sitter CST structure is different from what we expected, which is causing issues with our visitors
- The primitive-visitor.test.ts and composite-visitor.test.ts tests are failing because they're looking for module_instantiation nodes, but the tree-sitter CST structure uses call_expression nodes instead
