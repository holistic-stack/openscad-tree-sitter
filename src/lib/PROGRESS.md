## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Parser Layer**: Handles raw text parsing into CST
2. **Query Layer**: Provides utilities for querying the CST
3. **AST Layer**: Transforms CST into a more usable AST
4. **Adapters**: Convert between tree-sitter nodes and domain-specific AST nodes
5. **Visitors**: Traverse the CST and generate AST nodes
   - **Base Visitor**: Provides common traversal functionality
   - **Specialized Visitors**: Handle specific node types (primitives, transformations, CSG operations)
   - **Composite Visitor**: Delegates to specialized visitors based on node type

### Current Issues
- The current implementation uses hardcoded special cases for test files instead of real parsing logic
- We need to implement proper visitor methods that extract information from CST nodes
- The module and function system is not fully implemented yet
- Expression handling needs improvement
- The sphere and cylinder primitives still use hardcoded special cases

### Next Steps
- Implement real parsing logic to replace hardcoded special cases (TOP PRIORITY)
  - Start with primitive operations (cube, sphere, cylinder)
    - Sphere primitive implementation (CURRENT TASK)
    - Cylinder primitive implementation (NEXT TASK)

  - Finally, implement CSG operations (union, difference, intersection)
- Add support for expression visitors
- Implement module and function system
- Improve error handling and recovery strategies
- Add more comprehensive tests for all OpenSCAD constructs

### Current Task: Sphere Primitive Implementation
- Analyze the CST structure for sphere primitives using the debug tools
- Create sphere-extractor.ts file to extract sphere parameters from CST nodes
- Implement createSphereNode method in PrimitiveVisitor
- Handle radius (r), diameter (d), and resolution parameters ($fn, $fa, $fs)
- Create sphere-extractor.test.ts to test the extractor directly
- Update sphere.test.ts to use proper testing approach (similar to cube.test.ts)
- Ensure all sphere-related tests pass with the real implementation

### Recently Completed

  - Created primitive-visitor.test.ts to test the createCubeNode method
  - Updated cube.test.ts to use mocks for testing
  - Fixed the implementation to handle all cube parameter variations correctly
  - All cube-related tests are now passing with proper test isolation

## Known Issues

- Some edge cases in complex expressions need additional testing
- Performance optimizations may be needed for large files
- Some AST node types may need refinement based on real-world usage
- Module and function definitions and calls need more work
- The sphere.test.ts tests are failing because the PrimitiveVisitor is not handling sphere parameters correctly
- The module-function.test.ts tests are failing because the ModuleVisitor and FunctionVisitor are not implemented yet
