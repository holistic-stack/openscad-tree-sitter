# OpenSCAD Tree-sitter Parser - Progress Documentation

## Current Status

### Core Components

#### Parser Implementation
- [x] Basic parser setup with web-tree-sitter
- [x] OpenSCAD grammar integration
- [x] CST (Concrete Syntax Tree) generation
- [ ] AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) generation from CST
- [ ] Support for incremental parsing

#### Tree Traversal
- [x] Basic cursor utilities for tree traversal
- [ ] Tree-sitter queries for common patterns
- [ ] Navigation between related nodes
- [ ] Support for finding specific node types

#### Query System
- [x] Basic query utilities
- [x] Query manager for handling tree-sitter queries
- [x] Support for common query patterns
- [ ] Query result caching
- [ ] Optimized query performance

#### CST to AST Transformation
- [x] Basic node adapters for common OpenSCAD constructs:
  - [x] Sphere3D
  - [x] RotateTransform
  - [x] DifferenceOperation
  - [x] IfStatement
  - [x] AssignmentStatement
  - [ ] Module definitions
  - [ ] Function definitions
  - [ ] Control structures (for, let, each)
- [x] Fallback adapter for unknown node types

#### Testing
- [x] Unit tests for core components
- [x] Integration tests for parser
- [x] Test coverage for node adapters
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Query Files
- [x] `highlights.scm` - Syntax highlighting queries
- [x] `dependencies.scm` - Dependency analysis queries
- [x] `folds.scm` - Code folding regions

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Parser Layer**: Handles raw text parsing into CST
2. **Query Layer**: Provides utilities for querying the CST
3. **AST Layer**: Transforms CST into a more usable AST
4. **Adapters**: Convert between tree-sitter nodes and domain-specific AST nodes

## Next Steps

See [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for detailed next steps and implementation tasks.

## Known Issues

- Some edge cases in complex expressions need additional testing
- Performance optimizations may be needed for large files
- Some AST node types may need refinement based on real-world usage
