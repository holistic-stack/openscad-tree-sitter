#### Testing
- [x] Unit tests for core components

### Query Files
- [x] `highlights.scm` - Syntax highlighting queries
- [x] `dependencies.scm` - Dependency analysis queries
- [x] `folds.scm` - Code folding regions

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Parser Layer**: Handles raw text parsing into CST
2. **Query Layer**: Provides utilities for querying the CST
3. **AST Layer**: Transforms CST into a more usable AST
4. **Adapters**: Convert between tree-sitter nodes and domain-specific AST nodes

## Recent Achievements

- Implemented initial AST generator for OpenSCAD code
- Added support for cube primitives and translate transformations
- Created integration tests for AST generation
- Refactored code to follow DRY and SRP principles
- Set up modular architecture for AST generation
- Implemented sphere and cylinder primitives
- Implemented rotate and scale transformations
- Implemented union, difference, and intersection CSG operations
- Created a direct AST generator for testing purposes
- Implemented control structures (if statements, for loops, let expressions)
- Added tests for control structures
- Implemented module and function system (definitions and instantiations)
- Added support for module parameters and children
- Added tests for modules and functions
- Implemented polyhedron primitive
- Implemented 2D primitives (circle, square, polygon, text)
- Implemented extrusion operations (linear_extrude, rotate_extrude)
- Added tests for new primitives and extrusion operations
- Implemented remaining transformations (mirror, multmatrix, color, offset)
- Added tests for transformations

## Next Steps

See [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for detailed next steps and implementation tasks.

### Recently Completed
- Implemented support for for loops with multiple variables
- Implemented support for nested let statements
- Enhanced each statement implementation to handle arrays/lists
- Added support for conditional expressions (ternary operator)
- Fixed the DirectASTGenerator to handle all control structures
- Updated the AST types to support new expression types
- All tests for control structures are now passing
- Fixed the DirectASTGenerator to handle transformation operations (scale, mirror, color, offset, multmatrix)
- All transformation tests are now passing
- Implemented support for rotate transformations
- All rotate tests are now passing
- Started implementing support for union operations

### Current Issues
- Union tests are failing due to an unterminated string literal in the DirectASTGenerator.ts file
- There are still failing tests in other modules (difference, intersection, primitives, module-function)
- The ModularASTGenerator needs to be updated to handle these other modules
- Some tests are using parseToAST instead of parseAST, which is causing errors

### Next Steps
- Fix the string literal issue in the union operations implementation
- Implement support for difference and intersection operations
- Fix the module and function tests
- Update the ModularASTGenerator to handle all types of operations

## Known Issues

- Some edge cases in complex expressions need additional testing
- Performance optimizations may be needed for large files
- Some AST node types may need refinement based on real-world usage
- The CSG Generator currently doesn't handle all types of child nodes correctly
- Union operations have an issue with unterminated string literals
- Difference and intersection operations are not fully implemented
- Module and function definitions and calls need more work
- Some tests are using parseToAST instead of parseAST, which is causing errors
