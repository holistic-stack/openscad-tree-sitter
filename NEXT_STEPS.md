# OpenSCAD Tree-sitter - Next Steps

This document outlines the progress made and the next steps to further enhance the OpenSCAD Tree-sitter grammar.

## Project Setup Completed

We've successfully set up the OpenSCAD Tree-sitter grammar:

✅ Project structure with all necessary directories
✅ Package.json with dependencies and scripts
✅ OpenSCAD grammar definition in grammar.js
✅ Syntax highlighting queries (highlights.scm)
✅ Code navigation tag queries (tags.scm)
✅ Basic test cases (all passing)
✅ Sample OpenSCAD files for testing

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Grammar Implementation
- ✅ Implemented all core OpenSCAD language constructs
- ✅ Fixed node field labeling for proper AST structure
- ✅ Handled operator precedence correctly
- ✅ Implemented string literals with different quotation types
- ✅ Added proper handling for module instantiations and function calls

### 2. Testing
- ✅ All test cases passing
- ✅ Verified grammar against real-world examples
- ✅ Implemented proper error recovery

### 3. Editor Integration
- ✅ Enhanced indentation rules (indents.scm) for all OpenSCAD constructs
- ✅ Enhanced folding rules (folds.scm) for all OpenSCAD constructs
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests for indentation and folding
- ✅ Created real-world example tests for validation

### 4. Syntax Highlighting
- ✅ Created working highlights.scm query file
- ✅ Added highlighting for all important language constructs
- ✅ Fixed issues with node type references

### 4. Code Navigation
- ✅ Implemented tags.scm for symbol definitions and references
- ✅ Properly marked function and module definitions
- ✅ Added support for variable references

### 5. Grammar Improvements
- ✅ Enhanced error recovery for better editor experience
- ✅ Added support for missing semicolons and unbalanced delimiters
- ✅ Improved handling of complex expressions
- ✅ Added real-world examples for comprehensive testing

### 6. WebAssembly Support
- ✅ Built and tested WebAssembly version
- ✅ Created browser test environment
- ✅ Added comprehensive examples for browser testing
- ✅ Implemented browser-based syntax tree visualization

## Completed Tasks

### WebAssembly Support

```bash
# Build the WebAssembly module
npm run build:wasm

# Test the WebAssembly module in Node.js
npm run test:wasm

# Test the WebAssembly module in a browser
npm run test:browser
```

### Real-World Examples

We've added several complex real-world examples to test the grammar:

1. **Mechanical Gearbox**: A parametric gearbox design with complex nested structures
2. **Architectural Model**: A building model with multiple floors and detailed features
3. **Mathematical Surfaces**: Complex mathematical functions and parametric surfaces

### Error Recovery

We've enhanced error recovery for common syntax errors:

1. **Missing Semicolons**: The parser now recovers from missing semicolons
2. **Unbalanced Delimiters**: The parser handles unbalanced parentheses, braces, and brackets
3. **Invalid Expressions**: The parser recovers from invalid expressions

### WebAssembly Integration

We've created a browser test environment for the WebAssembly build:

1. **Browser Test Page**: A simple HTML page to test the parser in a browser
2. **Example Code**: Multiple examples to test different language features
3. **Syntax Tree Visualization**: Visual representation of the parsed syntax tree

## Future Improvements

### 1. Editor Integration

#### For VSCode
1. Create a dedicated extension
2. Implement language configuration
3. Set up Tree-sitter WebAssembly integration
4. Add code intelligence features

#### For Neovim
1. Create a proper plugin
2. Add TreeSitter configuration
3. Implement custom queries for folding and indentation

### 2. Additional Language Features

1. **External Scanner**: Implement an external scanner in C for more complex patterns
2. **Advanced Constructs**: Add support for more advanced OpenSCAD features
3. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize the parser for large files

## Running the Project

### Generate the Parser

```bash
npx tree-sitter generate
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npx tree-sitter test
```

### Test with Real Files

```bash
npx tree-sitter parse examples/sample.scad
```
