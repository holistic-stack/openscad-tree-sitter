# OpenSCAD Tree-sitter - Next Steps

This document outlines the next steps to get your OpenSCAD Tree-sitter grammar fully operational.

## Project Setup Completed

We've successfully set up the basic structure for the OpenSCAD Tree-sitter grammar:

✅ Project structure with all necessary directories
✅ Package.json with dependencies and scripts
✅ OpenSCAD grammar definition in grammar.js
✅ Syntax highlighting queries
✅ Code navigation tag queries
✅ Basic test cases
✅ Sample OpenSCAD file for testing
✅ Node.js bindings for integration
✅ Documentation (README, memory bank)

## Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Or using pnpm (as specified in package.json)
pnpm install
```

### 2. Generate the Parser

```bash
# Run the build script
npm run build
# or
pnpm build
```

This will create the C source files in the `src/` directory.

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
# Run the test command
npm test
# or
pnpm test
```

This will run the tests defined in the `test/corpus/` directory.

### 4. Test with Real Files

```bash
# Parse a real OpenSCAD file
npm run parse examples/sample.scad
# or
pnpm parse examples/sample.scad
```

### 5. Test Syntax Highlighting

```bash
# Generate a syntax highlighted version
npm run highlight examples/sample.scad
# or
pnpm highlight examples/sample.scad
```

### 6. Run the Playground

```bash
# Start the Tree-sitter playground for interactive testing
npm run playground
# or
pnpm playground
```

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### Parser Generation Fails

- Make sure you have the tree-sitter-cli installed globally or locally
- Check that the grammar.js has no syntax errors
- Ensure all required directories exist

### Tests Fail

- Examine the test output to see which test cases are failing
- Review the grammar.js to fix any issues with the grammar rules
- Update the test cases if the expected tree structure has changed

### Node.js Binding Issues

- Ensure node-gyp is installed and configured properly
- Check that you have a C/C++ compiler installed
- Verify the binding.gyp file has the correct paths

## Future Development

1. **External Scanner**: If you encounter limitations with the current grammar, you might need to implement an external scanner in C.
2. **Additional Features**: Consider adding support for more advanced OpenSCAD features.
3. **Editor Integration**: Create specific guides for integrating with different editors.
4. **WebAssembly Build**: Generate a WebAssembly version for browser-based editors.
5. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize the parser for large files.
