# OpenSCAD Tree-Sitter Monorepo Migration Summary

This document provides a summary of the monorepo migration plan and resources.

## Migration Overview

The OpenSCAD Tree-Sitter project is being migrated to an Nx monorepo with PNPM workspaces. This migration will:

1. Split the codebase into two packages:
   - `tree-sitter-openscad`: Tree-sitter grammar for OpenSCAD
   - `openscad-parser`: TypeScript parser for OpenSCAD

2. Improve build performance with Nx caching

3. Enhance dependency management with PNPM workspaces

4. Provide better organization and separation of concerns

## Migration Resources

The following resources are available to help with the migration:

- [Migration Plan](./monorepo-migration.md): Detailed plan for the migration
- [Migration Steps](./monorepo-migration-steps.md): Step-by-step guide for the migration
- [Monorepo Structure](./monorepo-structure.md): Diagram and description of the new structure
- [Structure Comparison](./structure-comparison.md): Comparison of current and new structures
- [Monorepo Commands](./monorepo-commands.md): Common commands for working with the monorepo
- [Monorepo FAQ](./monorepo-faq.md): Frequently asked questions about the migration

## Sample Configuration Files

Sample configuration files are provided to help with the migration:

- [Sample Root package.json](./sample-root-package.json): Root package.json for the monorepo
- [Sample Tree-Sitter package.json](./sample-tree-sitter-openscad-package.json): Package.json for the tree-sitter-openscad package
- [Sample Parser package.json](./sample-openscad-parser-package.json): Package.json for the openscad-parser package
- [Sample nx.json](./sample-nx-config.json): Nx configuration for the monorepo
- [Sample pnpm-workspace.yaml](./sample-pnpm-workspace.yaml): PNPM workspace configuration

## Migration Script

A migration script is provided to help with the migration:

- [Migration Script](../scripts/monorepo-migration.js): Script with migration steps

## New README

A new README.md is provided for the monorepo:

- [Monorepo README](./monorepo-readme.md): README.md for the monorepo

## Next Steps

1. Review the migration plan and resources
2. Create a backup of the current repository
3. Follow the step-by-step migration guide
4. Test the migration
5. Update documentation
6. Clean up unnecessary files

## Timeline

- Initial setup: 1 day
- File migration: 1-2 days
- Testing and fixing issues: 1-2 days
- Documentation: 1 day
- Total estimated time: 4-6 days

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Better Organization**: Clear separation between the grammar and parser
2. **Independent Versioning**: Each package can be versioned independently
3. **Improved Build Performance**: Nx caching improves build times
4. **Better Dependency Management**: Dependencies are scoped to the packages that need them
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to one package don't affect the other
6. **Clearer Organization**: Code is organized by functionality
7. **Improved Testing**: Tests are co-located with the code they test
