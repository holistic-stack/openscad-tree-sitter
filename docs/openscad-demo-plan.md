// Transformations
translate([15, 0, 0]) 
    rotate([0, 45, 0]) 
        cube(8);

// Control Structures
for (i = [0:2:10]) {
    translate([i*12, 20, 0]) 
        cube(5);
}

// Custom Modules
module custom_part(size, height) {
    difference() {
        cube([size, size, height]);
        translate([size/2, size/2, -1])
            cylinder(h=height+2, r=size/4);
    }
}

// Usage
custom_part(15, 8);
```

## 2. Next Phase Opportunities
