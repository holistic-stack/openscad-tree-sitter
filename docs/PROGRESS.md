# OpenSCAD Tree-sitter Parser - Progress Log

## 2025-05-23: Phase 2 Comprehensive Planning COMPLETED - Ready for Implementation! ðŸš€

### Major Achievement: Comprehensive Phase 2 Plan with 45 Integration Tests

**COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING SUCCESS**: Created detailed implementation plan for Phase 2 intermediate constructs with **45 comprehensive integration tests** targeting 100% success rate

### Phase 2 Scope and Planning

**ðŸŽ¯ Target Constructs (18-25 hours total)**:
1. **Enhanced Variable and Expression Handling** (6-8 hours, 15 tests)
   - Complex assignments, mathematical expressions, vector/range operations
   - Special variables ($fn, $fa, $fs), function calls in expressions

2. **Advanced Control Structure Support** (4-6 hours, 12 tests)
   - If-else chains, nested for loops, intersection_for operations
   - Complex conditions, nested structures, range expressions in loops

3. **Function and Module Definition Support** (6-8 hours, 18 tests)

4. **Special Variables and Context Support** (2-3 hours, integrated)
   - Resolution parameters, animation variables, view parameters, module context
   - $fn/$fa/$fs, $t, $vpr/$vpt, $children/$preview

### Research and Analysis Completed

**âœ… OpenSCAD Syntax Research**:
- Analyzed OpenSCAD User Manual for function and module definitions
- Researched real-world examples for variable assignments and expressions
- Studied control structure patterns and special variable usage
- Identified integration test patterns for comprehensive coverage

**âœ… Current Implementation Analysis**:
- Reviewed all existing visitor classes and their capabilities
- Identified enhancement points for VariableVisitor, ControlStructureVisitor, FunctionVisitor, ModuleVisitor
- Analyzed existing test data files and integration test structure
- Confirmed Phase 1 foundation is solid for Phase 2 extension

### Key Planning Decisions

1. **Incremental Implementation Strategy**:
   - Break Phase 2 into 4 sequential tasks with clear dependencies
   - Each task has specific subtasks, time estimates, and success metrics
   - Build upon Phase 1's successful visitor pattern and test structure

2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**:
   - Target 45 integration tests covering all intermediate constructs
   - Real-world OpenSCAD examples for practical validation
   - No mocks - all tests use actual CST parsing for authenticity

3. **Visitor Enhancement Approach**:
   - Enhance existing visitors rather than creating new ones
   - Maintain backward compatibility with Phase 1 achievements
   - Use composition and delegation patterns established in Phase 1

## 2025-05-23: Phase 1 Integration Tests COMPLETED - Perfect Success! ðŸŽ‰

### Major Achievement: 100% Test Success Rate

**INCREDIBLE SUCCESS**: Completed Phase 1 integration tests with **30/30 tests passing (100% success rate)**

### Issues Resolved

1. **Fixed Missing Method in VariableVisitor**:
   - Added missing `createASTNodeForFunction` method to VariableVisitor
   - Method returns null to delegate function calls to other visitors
   - Resolves abstract method implementation requirement

2. **Fixed Method Signature in ExpressionVisitor**:
   - Corrected `createASTNodeForFunction` method signature to match BaseASTVisitor
   - Changed from `(node: TSNode)` to `(node: TSNode, functionName: string, args: ast.Parameter[])`
   - Method now properly implements the abstract method contract

### Test Results Summary

**All 30 Phase 1 tests now passing:**
- âœ… **3D Primitives (10/10)**: cube, sphere, cylinder - all parameter combinations working
- âœ… **2D Primitives (4/4)**: circle, square, text - all working perfectly
- âœ… **Basic Transformations (11/11)**: translate, rotate, scale - all working perfectly
- âœ… **Boolean Operations (5/5)**: union, difference - all working perfectly

### Key Decisions

1. **Visitor Method Implementation Strategy**:
   - VariableVisitor returns null for function calls (delegates to other visitors)
   - ExpressionVisitor returns null for function calls (delegates to other visitors)
   - Specialized visitors (PrimitiveVisitor, TransformVisitor, CSGVisitor) handle specific functions
   - CompositeVisitor tries each visitor in sequence until one handles the function

2. **Error Handling Approach**:
   - Abstract method enforcement ensures all visitors implement required methods
   - Proper delegation allows specialized handling without conflicts
   - Graceful fallback when visitors can't handle specific function types

1. **Type System Improvements**:
   - Exported `ExtractedParameter` and `ExtractedNamedArgument` types from `argument-extractor.ts`
   - Updated `BaseASTVisitor.createASTNodeForFunction` signature to use `ExtractedParameter[]` instead of `ast.Parameter[]`
   - Ensured consistent type usage throughout the visitor hierarchy

2. **Transform Visitor Enhancements**:
   - Fixed vector handling in `createTranslateNode`, `createRotateNode`, `createScaleNode`, and `createMirrorNode`
   - Implemented proper vector dimension validation (Vector2D vs Vector3D)
   - Added default values for missing or invalid transform parameters
   - Enhanced parameter extraction with improved type guards

3. **Parameter Handling**:
   - Updated the parameter map access to safely handle both named and unnamed arguments
   - Improved vector evaluation to handle different input formats
   - Added detailed logging for better debugging and traceability

### Key Decisions

1. **Parameter Extraction Pattern**:
   - Decided to use `ExtractedParameter[]` as the primary interface between argument extraction and AST node creation
   - Implemented specific type guards to distinguish between named arguments (`ExtractedNamedArgument`) and value arguments (`ast.Value`)
   - Ensured that parameter conversions happen at the right level in the code to maintain type safety

2. **Vector Handling**:
   - Implemented dimension-aware vector handling to ensure proper assignment to Vector2D, Vector3D, and Vector4D types
   - Added safety checks with appropriate error messages when vector dimensions don't match expected values
   - Used type assertions with validation to maintain type safety while allowing flexible parameter handling

3. **Default Values**:
   - Added sensible defaults for all transform parameters to match OpenSCAD's behavior
   - Documented the default values in code comments for better maintainability
   - Ensured consistency in default value application across all transform typesent handling of missing or invalid parameters

## 2025-05-21: Implementing Visitor Pattern for CST Traversal

### Completed Tasks

1. **Updated Test Files**:
   - Modified intersection.test.ts, minkowski.test.ts, module-function.test.ts, and control-structures.test.ts
   - Updated all tests to use the CompositeVisitor for AST generation
   - Removed mock implementations of OpenscadParser.parseAST
   - Fixed test expectations to match the actual behavior of the real parser

2. **Implemented Visitor Pattern**:
   - Created BaseASTVisitor class with default implementations for all visit methods
   - Implemented specialized visitors for different node types (primitives, transformations, CSG operations)
   - Created CompositeVisitor that delegates to specialized visitors based on node type
   - Updated OpenscadParser to use the visitor-based AST generator by default

3. **Fixed transform-visitor.ts**:
   - Updated color parameter extraction to handle both string and vector color formats
   - Enhanced alpha parameter extraction to use the extractNumberParameter utility
   - Updated offset node parameter extraction to use the appropriate extraction utilities

### Key Decisions

1. **Visitor Pattern Implementation**:
   - Chose a composite visitor pattern to allow specialized handling for different node types
   - Implemented a base visitor class to provide default behavior for all node types
   - Used method overriding to customize behavior for specific node types

2. **Parameter Extraction**:
   - Developed utility functions for common parameter extraction patterns
   - Standardized parameter extraction across all node types for consistency
   - Added type-specific extractors for numeric, string, and vector parameters

## 2025-05-20: Initial AST Generator Implementation

### Completed Tasks

1. **Defined AST Node Types**:
   - Created interfaces for all OpenSCAD AST node types
   - Defined type hierarchies for expressions, statements, and declarations
   - Added utility types for vectors, matrices, and parameters

2. **Implemented Basic AST Generator**:
   - Developed core functions for traversing the CST
   - Created utility functions for extracting information from CST nodes
   - Added error handling and reporting for invalid syntax

3. **Added Initial Tests**:
   - Created tests for basic OpenSCAD constructs
   - Added tests for primitive shapes with parameters
   - Tested simple transformations and CSG operations

### Key Decisions

1. **AST Structure**:
   - Designed AST to closely match OpenSCAD's semantic structure
   - Added type information to facilitate downstream processing
   - Included location information for error reporting

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Adopted a Test-Driven Development approach
   - Created tests for both valid and invalid inputs
   - Focused on edge cases and parameter variations
