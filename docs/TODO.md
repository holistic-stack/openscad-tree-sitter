# OpenSCAD Parser TODO List

This document outlines the remaining tasks and future enhancements for the OpenSCAD parser.

## CRITICAL PRIORITY: Consolidate Parser on Pure Tree-sitter
- **Objective**: Remove all ANTLR remnants. Ensure `ExpressionVisitor.ts` and its sub-visitors (`BinaryExpressionVisitor`, `UnaryExpressionVisitor`, `ConditionalExpressionVisitor`, `ParenthesizedExpressionVisitor`) are purely Tree-sitter based, correctly implemented, and robustly tested.
- **Status**: Sub-visitor implementation and integration complete. Review, cleanup, and comprehensive testing pending.
- **Tasks**:
  - **`ExpressionVisitor.ts` Core Logic**:
    - [x] Initial repair of `visitExpression` to delegate to `createExpressionNode` or handle simple cases.
    - [ ] **CRITICAL: Review and Refine `ExpressionVisitor.visitExpression`**: Thoroughly review the `visitExpression` method against Tree-sitter grammar to ensure all expression types are covered and correctly dispatched. Address concerns about lost logic from previous automated edits. This is the immediate next coding task.
  - **Sub-Visitor Implementation (All Completed)**:
    - **`BinaryExpressionVisitor` (Tree-sitter)**: [x] All implementation and integration tasks completed.
    - **`UnaryExpressionVisitor` (Tree-sitter)**: [x] All implementation and integration tasks completed.
    - **`ConditionalExpressionVisitor` (Tree-sitter)**: [x] All implementation and integration tasks completed.
    - **`ParenthesizedExpressionVisitor` (Tree-sitter)**: [x] All implementation and integration tasks completed.
  - **Cleanup and Finalization**:
    - [ ] Remove obsolete placeholder methods (e.g., old `visitBinaryExpression` stubs that are not part of the sub-visitors) from `ExpressionVisitor.ts`.
    - [ ] Remove all temporary `console.log`/`console.warn` statements from `ExpressionVisitor.ts` and all its sub-visitors.
    - [ ] Remove any remaining ANTLR-specific code or comments from the `openscad-parser` package.
  - **Comprehensive Testing**:
    - [ ] Add comprehensive tests for `BinaryExpressionVisitor` covering all binary operators, precedence, and edge cases.
    - [ ] Add comprehensive tests for `UnaryExpressionVisitor` for all unary operators and edge cases.
    - [ ] Add comprehensive tests for `ConditionalExpressionVisitor` for conditional expressions, including nested ones.
    - [ ] Add comprehensive tests for `ParenthesizedExpressionVisitor` for parenthesized expressions, including nested ones.
    - [ ] Run `pnpm nx test openscad-parser` and ensure all tests pass after review and cleanup.

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. Implement Full Test Coverage for All Visitors
- **Goal**: Achieve near 100% test coverage for all visitor classes.
- **Status**: Partially Done (Error handling and some expression visitors have good coverage)

- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Review existing test coverage for each visitor.
  - [ ] Identify gaps in test coverage.
  - [ ] Write new tests to cover missing scenarios.
  - [ ] Ensure tests cover both valid and invalid inputs.
  - [ ] Verify correct AST node generation and error reporting.
- **Priority**: High
- **Assignee**: TBD
- **Estimated Time**: 10-12 hours

### 2. Refine and Test Error Recovery Strategies
- **Goal**: Improve the robustness and effectiveness of error recovery strategies.
- **Status**: Partially Done (Basic strategies implemented and tested)
- **Description**: Further test and refine existing error recovery strategies. Implement new strategies for common OpenSCAD syntax errors not yet covered.
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Test existing recovery strategies with a wider range of syntax errors.
  - [ ] Identify common syntax errors not yet handled by recovery strategies.
  - [ ] Implement new recovery strategies (e.g., for mismatched block delimiters, incomplete statements).
  - [ ] Ensure recovery strategies do not cause cascading errors or infinite loops.
  - [ ] Evaluate the performance impact of recovery strategies.
- **Priority**: High
- **Assignee**: TBD
- **Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours

## Medium Priority Tasks

### 3. Advanced Feature Support
- **Goal**: Implement parsing for advanced OpenSCAD features.
- **Status**: Planned
- **Description**: Add support for features like `let`, `assign` (as distinct from variable declaration), `assert`, list comprehensions, and potentially the `offset` module if its syntax is distinct.
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] `let` statements/expressions.
  - [ ] `assign` statements.
  - [ ] `assert` module/statement.
  - [ ] List comprehensions (including `for` and `if` clauses within them).
  - [ ] `offset` module (if syntax requires special handling beyond a normal module call).
  - [ ] Add corresponding visitor implementations and tests.
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Assignee**: TBD
- **Estimated Time**: 12-16 hours

### 4. Enhance AST with Semantic Information (Deferred)
- **Goal**: Add semantic information to AST nodes for better downstream processing.
- **Status**: Planned (Deferred until core parsing is stable)
- **Description**: Augment AST nodes with semantic information like type information, scope details, and resolved references.
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Implement basic type inference.
  - [ ] Add scope resolution for variables and functions.
  - [ ] Link variable references to their declarations.
  - [ ] Add type checking for function calls and assignments.
- **Dependencies**: Requires stable core AST generation.
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Assignee**: TBD
- **Estimated Time**: 15-20 hours

### 5. Performance Optimization for Large Files
- **Goal**: Ensure the parser performs efficiently on large OpenSCAD files.
- **Status**: Planned
- **Description**: Profile the parser with large and complex OpenSCAD files to identify performance bottlenecks. Optimize critical code paths.
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Create benchmark tests with large OpenSCAD files.
  - [ ] Profile parser performance to identify bottlenecks.
  - [ ] Optimize CST traversal and AST node creation.
  - [ ] Investigate memory usage and optimize if necessary.
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Assignee**: TBD
- **Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours

### 6. Include/Use Statement Enhancements (Deferred)
- **Goal**: Enhance parsing and AST representation for `include` and `use` statements.
- **Status**: Planned (Deferred)
- **Description**: Improve how `include` and `use` statements are handled, potentially resolving paths or linking to external file ASTs if feasible within the scope of a standalone parser.
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Consider path resolution strategies (e.g., relative to current file).
  - [ ] Explore options for representing the content of included/used files in the AST (e.g., as nested ASTs or through a separate mechanism).
  - [ ] Add tests for various include/use scenarios.
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Assignee**: TBD
- **Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

## Low Priority Tasks

  - [ ] Implement comment extraction and association with AST nodes.
  - [ ] Add support for documentation annotations (e.g., JSDoc-like syntax in comments).
  - [ ] Create HTML/Markdown documentation generator.
  - [ ] Implement cross-reference generation.

- **Assignee**: TBD
- **Estimated Time**: 6-10 hours
