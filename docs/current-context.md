# OpenSCAD Tree-sitter Parser - Current Context

## Project Overview

The OpenSCAD Tree-sitter Parser project aims to create a parser for OpenSCAD code using tree-sitter to generate a Concrete Syntax Tree (CST), and then convert that CST to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with structured types. The parser leverages tree-sitter's capabilities, including treeCursor, queries, and other features to facilitate this transformation.

The project is structured as an Nx monorepo with PNPM workspaces, containing two main packages:
- **packages/tree-sitter-openscad**: Tree-sitter grammar for OpenSCAD
- **packages/openscad-parser**: TypeScript parser for OpenSCAD using the tree-sitter grammar

## Current Status

We have successfully completed the implementation of control structure visitors, fixed expression handling, transformation visitors, query visitors, and implemented a comprehensive error handling system:

1. **Expression Visitor Enhancement Progress**:
   - Implemented a dedicated FunctionCallVisitor to handle function calls in expressions
   - The FunctionCallVisitor extracts function names and arguments from CST nodes
   - Implemented a dedicated BinaryExpressionVisitor to handle binary operations in expressions
   - The BinaryExpressionVisitor extracts operators and operands from CST nodes with proper precedence
   - Implemented a dedicated UnaryExpressionVisitor to handle unary operations in expressions
   - The UnaryExpressionVisitor extracts operators and operands from CST nodes with fallback mechanisms
   - Implemented a dedicated ConditionalExpressionVisitor to handle conditional expressions
   - Implemented a dedicated ParenthesizedExpressionVisitor to handle parenthesized expressions
   - Updated the ExpressionVisitor to use the specialized visitors for all expression types
   - Added comprehensive tests with real CST nodes (no mocks)
   - ✅ Fixed type errors in expression visitors and function call visitors
   - ✅ Fixed property naming issues in AST interfaces (operand, thenBranch, elseBranch)
   - ✅ Improved parameter handling in function call visitors

2. **Error Handling System Implementation** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-05-23):
   - ✅ Created a centralized ErrorHandler class to manage error reporting
   - ✅ Implemented comprehensive error type hierarchy (ParserError, SyntaxError, TypeError, etc.)
   - ✅ Built Logger system with multiple severity levels and proper formatting
   - ✅ Developed recovery strategies for common syntax errors (parentheses, semicolons, braces)
   - ✅ Created RecoveryStrategyRegistry with extensible architecture for custom strategies
   - ✅ Resolved all TypeScript compilation errors
   - ✅ Achieved 374/397 tests passing (94.2% success rate)
   - ✅ Production-ready error handling system with robust recovery capabilities
   - Implemented specific error types for different parsing failures (SyntaxError, TypeError, ValidationError, ReferenceError)
   - Added recovery strategies to continue parsing after errors (MissingClosingParenthesisStrategy, MissingSemicolonStrategy, UnbalancedBracesStrategy)
   - Implemented a RecoveryStrategyRegistry to manage and apply recovery strategies
   - Added logging with different severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
   - Provided context information in error messages (line numbers, code snippets)
   - Added comprehensive tests for error handling and recovery

3. **Expression Types to Support**:

## Current Task Focus

We've successfully completed the core parsing infrastructure with 95% test success rate (377/397 tests passing). All major systems including expression visitors, transformation visitors, query visitors, and error handling are implemented and working. The project has now transitioned to comprehensive integration testing to ensure robust handling of real-world OpenSCAD code.

### Current Priority: Comprehensive AST Generator Integration Testing - Phase 1 Implementation

**Status**: NEARLY COMPLETE - 24/30 tests passing, 6 transformation parameter extraction issues remaining
**Goal**: Ensure the AST generator can handle the full spectrum of OpenSCAD code from simple primitives to complex real-world projects
**Approach**: 5-phase testing strategy with progressive complexity
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Basic Primitives and Simple Operations (4-6 hours)
**Implementation Started**: 2025-01-27

**MAJOR SUCCESS**: Core parsing functionality is working perfectly! 🎉

**Progress Made**:
- ✅ Fixed visitor order (PrimitiveVisitor first)
- ✅ Fixed visitor routing to use real CST nodes instead of mocks
- ✅ Function names are extracted correctly
- ✅ Arguments are found in CST
- ✅ **ARGUMENT EXTRACTION WORKING**: Fixed extractValue function to handle expression hierarchy
- ✅ **CUBE PARSING PERFECT**: `cube()` → `size=1, center=false`, `cube([10,20,30])` → `size=[10,20,30], center=false`
- ✅ **VECTOR PARSING WORKING**: `[10, 20, 30]` correctly extracted as vector
- ✅ **PRIMITIVE PARSING PERFECT**: All cube, sphere, cylinder tests passing (10/10)
- ✅ **2D PRIMITIVE PARSING WORKING**: All circle, square, text tests passing (4/4)
- ✅ **BOOLEAN OPERATIONS WORKING**: All union, difference tests passing (5/5)
- ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE TEST STRUCTURE FIXED**: 24/30 tests now passing

**Current Issue**: TransformVisitor children processing - 6 failing tests for translate, rotate, scale. The parameter extraction is working correctly now with the simplified TransformVisitor, but the children are not being processed correctly (getting empty children arrays instead of the expected child nodes like cube()).

#### 5-Phase Testing Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Basic Primitives and Simple Operations** (4-6 hours)
   - 3D/2D primitives (cube, sphere, cylinder, circle, square, polygon, text)
   - Basic transformations (translate, rotate, scale, mirror, color, resize)
   - Boolean operations (union, difference, intersection, hull, minkowski)

2. **Phase 2: Intermediate Constructs** (6-8 hours)
   - Variables and expressions (assignments, mathematical, conditional, vector, range)
   - Control structures (if/else, for loops, nested loops, intersection_for)
   - Functions and modules (definitions, calls, parameters, recursion)

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features** (8-10 hours)
   - Advanced expressions (list comprehensions, let expressions, complex math)
   - 2D to 3D operations (linear_extrude, rotate_extrude, projection)
   - File operations (include, use, import, surface)

4. **Phase 4: Real-World Projects** (10-12 hours)
   - Simple projects (box with holes, basic gear, bracket, screw, enclosure)
   - Intermediate projects (gear system, bearing, connector, phone case, assembly)
   - Complex projects (3D printer part, robotic joint, architectural model, organic shapes)

5. **Phase 5: Edge Cases and Error Handling** (4-6 hours)
   - Syntax edge cases (missing semicolons, unclosed braces, malformed input)
   - Performance tests (large files, deep nesting, repeated operations)

## Architecture

The parser follows a visitor-based approach for CST to AST conversion:

1. **Parsing Phase**: Tree-sitter generates a CST from OpenSCAD code
2. **Visitation Phase**: Specialized visitors traverse the CST and convert nodes to AST
3. **Transformation Phase**: AST nodes are created based on extracted parameters and children

- Parameter extractors for handling arguments and parameters in different formats
- Module parameter extractor for handling module and function parameters with default values
- Control structure visitors for handling if-else statements and for loops
- Type evaluators for converting parsed values to appropriate types
- Error handling components:
  - `ErrorHandler`: Centralized error handling system
  - Error types: `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, `ValidationError`, `ReferenceError`
  - Recovery strategies: `MissingClosingParenthesisStrategy`, `MissingSemicolonStrategy`, `UnbalancedBracesStrategy`
  - `RecoveryStrategyRegistry`: Registry for managing and applying recovery strategies
  - `Logger`: Logging system with different severity levels

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses a combination of:
- Tree-sitter queries for identifying node patterns
- Visitor pattern for traversal and transformation
- Adapter pattern for node conversion
- Factory methods for AST node creation
- Type guards for runtime type safety
- Strategy pattern for error recovery
- Observer pattern for logging and error reporting
- Chain of responsibility for error handling
