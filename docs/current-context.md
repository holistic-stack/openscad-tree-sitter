# OpenSCAD Tree-sitter Parser - Current Context

## Project Overview

The OpenSCAD Tree-sitter Parser project aims to create a parser for OpenSCAD code using tree-sitter to generate a Concrete Syntax Tree (CST), and then convert that CST to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with structured types. The parser leverages tree-sitter's capabilities, including treeCursor, queries, and other features to facilitate this transformation.

The project is structured as an Nx monorepo with PNPM workspaces, containing two main packages:
- **packages/tree-sitter-openscad**: Tree-sitter grammar for OpenSCAD
- **packages/openscad-parser**: TypeScript parser for OpenSCAD using the tree-sitter grammar

## Architecture

The parser follows a visitor-based approach for CST to AST conversion:

1. **Parsing Phase**: Tree-sitter generates a CST from OpenSCAD code
2. **Visitation Phase**: Specialized visitors traverse the CST and convert nodes to AST
3. **Transformation Phase**: AST nodes are created based on extracted parameters and children

### Parser Components

Key components include:
- `BaseASTVisitor`: Base implementation of the visitor pattern
- Specialized visitors for different node types (primitives, transformations, CSG operations, modules, functions, control structures)
- Parameter extractors for handling arguments and parameters in different formats
- Module parameter extractor for handling module and function parameters with default values
- Control structure visitors for handling if-else statements and for loops
- Type evaluators for converting parsed values to appropriate types
- Error handling components:
  - `ErrorHandler`: Centralized error handling system
  - Error types: `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, `ValidationError`, `ReferenceError`
  - Recovery strategies: `MissingClosingParenthesisStrategy`, `MissingSemicolonStrategy`, `UnbalancedBracesStrategy`
  - `RecoveryStrategyRegistry`: Registry for managing and applying recovery strategies
  - `Logger`: Logging system with different severity levels

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses a combination of:
- Tree-sitter queries for identifying node patterns
- Visitor pattern for traversal and transformation
- Adapter pattern for node conversion
- Factory methods for AST node creation
- Type guards for runtime type safety
- Strategy pattern for error recovery
- Observer pattern for logging and error reporting
- Chain of responsibility for error handling

## Documentation and Testing

Comprehensive documentation and testing are essential for this project:
- Each AST node type has documented parameter patterns
